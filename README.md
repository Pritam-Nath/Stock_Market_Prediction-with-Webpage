📈 Stock Market Prediction Web App

🔗 Live Demo: https://pritamnath2025.streamlit.app/

A machine learning–based stock market prediction web application built using Streamlit, which analyzes historical stock data and predicts future prices with interactive visualizations.


---

🚀 Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end stock market prediction system, combining data collection, preprocessing, machine learning, and web deployment.
Users can select a stock symbol, view historical trends, and see predicted future prices directly in a web browser.

🧠 Key Features

✔ Fetches real-time & historical stock data
✔ Predicts future stock prices using ML models
✔ Interactive charts and tables
✔ Clean, responsive UI built with Streamlit
✔ Deployed live on Streamlit Cloud (no setup needed)

📌 Installation & Setup (Local)

> Optional: Only required if you want to run the project on your local system.



1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Pritam-Nath/Stock_Market_Prediction-with-Webpage.git

2️⃣ Navigate into the Project

cd Stock_Market_Prediction-with-Webpage

3️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows

4️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

5️⃣ Run the App

streamlit run app.py

📊 How It Works

1. Stock market data is fetched using APIs (e.g., yfinance)


2. Data is cleaned, scaled, and prepared


3. Pre-trained ML model predicts future prices


4. Results are visualized using interactive charts


5. Output is displayed via Streamlit web UI
